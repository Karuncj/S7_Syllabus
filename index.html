             Formation of IEC and guide allotment shall be completed within a week after the
            University examination (or last working day) of the previous semester.<br>
             Guide shall provide required input to their students regarding the selection of topic/
            paper.<br>
             Choosing a seminar topic: The topic for a UG seminar should be current and broad
            based rather than a very specific research work. It's advisable to choose a topic for the
            Seminar to be closely linked to the final year project area. Every member of the project
            team could choose or be assigned Seminar topics that covers various aspects linked to
            the Project area.</p></li>
